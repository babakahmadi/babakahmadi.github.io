      <description>As a programmer, I reviewed a lot of codes(specially in java) and I saw a lot of problems in them. One of the most common problems that I saw is violating the SOLID principles. You know, when I started programming with java, I had these kind of problems too and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know these principles but after knowing that, my codes were better than before and I think these kind of principles prevents us from very large number of issues in programming and help us to scale our code, so it would be great to write a blog about it.</description>
